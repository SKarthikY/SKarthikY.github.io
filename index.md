# Welcome to My Personal Research Website!

I am an Astrophysics graduate student at Harvard University and I study core-collapse supernovae â€“ the violent explosions of massive stars when they reach the end of their life. These supernovae are so violent and bright that they can be seen across hundreds of megaparsecs from distant galaxies!

Because this explosion happens when a star dies, it can be used to probe the details of how stars die and the unique processes that happen during stellar death.
