I am an Astrophysics graduate student at Harvard University and I study core-collapse supernovae â€“ the violent explosions of massive stars when they reach the end of their life. These supernovae are so violent and bright that they can be seen across hundreds of megaparsecs from distant galaxies! Because this explosion happens when a star dies, it can be used to probe the details of how stars die and the unique processes that happen during stellar death. 

My name is Karthik Yadavalli. I was born in India, and grew up right outside Atlanta, Georgia. I graduated from Georgia Institute of Technology with a major in physics (concentration: Astrophysics) and a minor in computational data analysis in May 2021. I graduated from the Pennsylvania State University in July 2023, and am currently in the second year of my PhD at Harvard University (as in, fourth year of grad school).

In my free time, I like to rock climb, volunteer, and ride my bicycle.
