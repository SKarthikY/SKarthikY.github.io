## SN 2022oqm
SN 2022oqm is a supernova that was detected back in July 2022. We obtained a lot of photometry and spectroscopy while it was still bright and visible for the next couple months. After that, I led a research project where we analyzed the all the obtained data to try to tell a story about what kind of star exploded, why it did so, and what its environment was. 

One of the most important conclusions from this project was that the radioactive isotope powering the light curve, $\rm{Ni^{56}}$, the isotope of Nickel with 28 neutrons and 28 protons (i.e. 56 nucleons) must have been mixed in the ejected material from the star.

## Radiative Transfer modeling of Supernovae
Many supernovae are powered by a radioative material. Radioactive material, often $\rm{Ni^{56}}$, radioactively decays into something more stable and emits gamma rays into the surroundings. These gamma rays are then absorbed and re-emitted by the surrounding material until eventually the light makes its way out of the thick cloud of ejecta. 

Therefore, by understanding how
