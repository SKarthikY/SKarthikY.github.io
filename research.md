## SN 2022oqm
SN 2022oqm is a supernova that was detected back in July 2022. We obtained a lot of photometry and spectroscopy while it was still bright and visible for the next couple months. After that, I led a research project where we analyzed the all the obtained data to try to tell a story about what kind of star exploded, why it did so, and what its environment was. 

One of the most important conclusions from this project was 


Radiative Transfer modeling of Supernovae
