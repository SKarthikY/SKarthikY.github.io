# About Me

Hello and Welcome!

My name is Karthik Yadavalli. I was born in India, and grew up right outside Atlanta, Georgia. I graduated from Georgia Institute of Technology with a major in physics (concentration: Astrophysics) and a minor in computational data analysis in May 2021. I graduated from the Pennsylvania State University in July 2023, and am currently in the second year of my PhD at Harvard University.

In my free time, I like to rock-climb, volunteer, and ride my bicycle. The picture on the right is from the top of a small mountain biking trail covered in snow!
